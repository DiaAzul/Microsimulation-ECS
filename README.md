# Microsimulation with Entity Component System

This code implements a simple microsimulation using the C# Arch Entity Component System framework.

The microsimulation models 20 years of births and deaths within a given population.

The synthetic population can be downloaded from (the file will need unpacking to get the protobuf file):

The assumptions are included in the Data folder.
